# NPoS-Economics

This repository includes all versions of the NPoS and Parachain Economics models. The Codes folder includes the
jupyter notebooks for the python implementation of the models as well as the figure and data files, and the Data folder includes the Kusama genesis 
account balances. The Notes folder include the notes for the very first version of the stochastic NPoS Economic model.
